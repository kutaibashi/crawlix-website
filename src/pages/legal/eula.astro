>
  <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you ("User") and Crawlix ("Company", "we", "us") for the use of the Crawlix desktop application ("Software").
  </p>
  <p>
    BY INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.
  </p>

  <h2>2. License Grant</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Free (Starter) License</h3>
  <p>
    The Free license grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Software with limited features as specified on our website.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Pro (Professional) License</h3>
  <p>
    The Pro license grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Software with enhanced features. This license may be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Annual:</strong> Valid for one year from the date of purchase, renewable</li>
    <li><strong>Perpetual:</strong> Valid indefinitely for the version purchased</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3 Agency (Enterprise) License</h3>
  <p>
    The Agency license grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Software with full features, including white-label capabilities and team seats as specified.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Device Activations</h2>
  <p>
    Each license tier includes a specific number of device activations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Free:</strong> 1 device</li>
    <li><strong>Pro:</strong> 1 device</li>
    <li><strong>Agency:</strong> 5 devices (team seats)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.1 License Binding</h3>
  <p>
    Licenses are permanently bound to your device(s) through secure hardware fingerprinting using stable system identifiers (e.g., BIOS/UEFI UUID). This binding cannot be self-service deactivated.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Reactivation on Same Device</h3>
  <p>
    If you reinstall your operating system, format your drive, or make changes that don't affect your hardware UUID, you may reactivate your license on the same device automatically. No support contact is required for same-device reactivation.
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 Transfer to New Device</h3>
  <p>
    To transfer your license to a different device (e.g., new computer), you must contact our support team at <a href="mailto:support@crawlix.app">support@crawlix.app</a>. We will verify your purchase and deactivate your license from the old device to allow activation on the new device. Legitimate transfer requests are typically processed within 24-48 hours.
  </p>

  <h3>3.4 Anti-Reselling Protection</h3>
  <p>
    Self-service deactivation is not available to prevent unauthorized license reselling. This policy helps us maintain fair pricing and protects legitimate customers from purchasing stolen or invalid licenses.</p>

  <h2>4. Authorized Sales Channels</h2>
