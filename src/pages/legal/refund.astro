>
  <h2>14-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
  <p>
    If you purchase Crawlix Pro or Crawlix Agency and are not satisfied for any reason, you can request a full refund within <strong>14 days</strong> of your purchase date.
  </p>

  <h3>Conditions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>First-time purchases only:</strong> Each customer is eligible for one refund</li>
    <li><strong>License revocation:</strong> Your license will be permanently revoked upon refund</li>
    <li><strong>Device restriction:</strong> The same hardware cannot be used for future purchases</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>EU Customers - Digital Content Waiver</h2>
  <p>
    Under the EU Consumer Rights Directive, consumers have a 14-day withdrawal right for online purchases. However, for digital content that is accessed immediately:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      By activating your license, you expressly consent to immediate access to the software and acknowledge that you waive your 14-day withdrawal right once the license is activated.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This waiver is displayed and requires your explicit consent during the license activation process.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Request a Refund</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Email <a href="mailto:support@crawlix.app">support@crawlix.app</a> with your order number or purchase email</li>
    <li>We'll verify your purchase and eligibility</li>
    <li>Refunds are processed within <strong>5-7 business days</strong></li>
    <li>Refunds are issued to the original payment method via Lemon Squeezy</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What Happens After a Refund</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your license key will be permanently revoked</li>
    <li>Your hardware fingerprint will be flagged (cannot activate new licenses)</li>
    <li>You'll lose access to Pro/Agency features immediately</li>
    <li>You can continue using the free version of Crawlix</li>
    <li>All data you've created locally remains on your machine</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Subscription Renewals</h2>
  <p>For annual subscriptions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cancel anytime from your <a href="https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lemon Squeezy customer portal</a></li>
    <li>Cancellation stops future renewals but doesn't refund the current period</li>
    <li>Forgot to cancel? Contact us within <strong>7 days</strong> of renewal for a full refund</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Perpetual Licenses</h2>
  <p>
    Perpetual (one-time purchase) licenses are also covered by our 14-day money-back guarantee. After 14 days, perpetual purchases are non-refundable as they provide indefinite access to the software.
  </p>

  <h2>Abuse Prevention</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to decline refunds in cases of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Repeat refunders:</strong> Multiple purchases and refunds from the same person</li>
    <li><strong>Same device:</strong> Hardware that was previously associated with a refunded license</li>
    <li><strong>Excessive usage:</strong> Significant use before requesting refund</li>
    <li><strong>Late requests:</strong> Refund requested after 14 days</li>
    <li><strong>Chargebacks:</strong> Filing chargebacks without contacting us first</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why This Policy?</h2>
  <p>
    Our refund policy protects legitimate customers and keeps prices fair:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prevents license reselling (buy, use, refund, repeat)</li>
    <li>Reduces fraud that would otherwise increase costs for everyone</li>
    <li>Ensures sustainable pricing for long-term product development</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We offer a <strong>free tier</strong> so you can thoroughly evaluate Crawlix before purchasing. Use the free version to ensure it meets your needs.
  </p>
